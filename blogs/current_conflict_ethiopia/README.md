#The untold story in the current conflict in Ethiopia:
##what the numbers are telling us?

###Introduction 

In a rare situation where Ethiopian scholars tell the story behind the current conflict in Ethiopia, Beharu Zewdie, Emeritus Professor of history at Addis Ababa University shared his voice on Nov 12 in an article on [News24]("https://www.news24.com/citypress/voices/the-age-of-disinformation-what-exactly-is-happening-in-ethiopia-20211111"). Prominent in Ethiopian history, the Professor reflected on the extent of disinformation and highlighted the context since the war broke out. The article begins by debunking the ignorance of the international news media about the immediate cause of the war which started during the night of Nov 3 after the Tigray Liberation Forces (TPLF) attacked and murdered members of the Northern Command Force as opposed to what the media portrays it to be on Nov 4 when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered the military operation. 

This blog post is an attempt to see if the historical perspective of the above article can be quantitatively verified using publicly available data. Before going further, however, I would like to remind my readers about the caveat to my approach that the data source, [Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED)]("https://acleddata.com"), might also be swayed by misinformation because of the fact that the information is mainly compiled from news articles. However, I hope this limitation remains minimal given that ACLED conducts manual screening on the data using teams in satellite offices in Ethiopia and elsewhere. Moreover, I would like to bring up that this post is not about finger pointing but only motivated by the cause of informing policy towards repairing the relationship between Ethiopia and the western countries. Let's dive in!  


###International media ignorance on the atrocities committed by TPLF 

Professor Beharu’s article goes on exposing the media campaign in addition to the deviation on how and when the war broke out. This includes the news coverage of atrocities by the international media which found to be one sided as opposed to the recent joint report by the UN and Ethiopian Human Rights Commission that came up with finding that all sides have been committing atrocities including TPLF.  


Figure 1 depicts the overall conflict events reported in the ACLED database extracted from a range of international and local media sources between Nov 3 2020 and Nov 12 2021. As you can see from the figure, a sizable number of conflict events occured in Amhara, Afar, Oromia and Benishangul Gumz regions besides Tigray. As such, we can conclude that the current conflict in Ethiopia is not only restricted to the Tigray region but also in most parts of the country. Therefore, it is worth investigating in detail if there is association between the conflict in Tigray region with the conflict in other regions perhaps due to spillover and proxy war conducted by the TPLF.

The table below summarizes the conflict record as reported by the international media and local media sources. Our focus here is on international pressure through the media and the top on this list are BBC, CNN, Reuters, Al Jazeera, The Economist,  AP, AFP and France24. These media sources were able to report on nearly half of the total conflict incidents that occurred in the country since Nov 3. From the outset, we might say that the international media has shown a noticeable interest to cover the ongoing situation in Ethiopia. However, a closer look at the detail of news coverage by region tells a different story where a significant number of the conflict incidents occured in the region other than Tigray are not being covered. For instance, only 27% and 35% of conflict incidents occured in Amhara (the second conflict prone region) and Afar were reported by the international news media out of the 455 and 105 conflict events, respectively. This is in stark contrast to 72% (591) for Tigray region out of 818 conflict events which is by no means a fair news coverage when we take into consideration the fact that the recent conflicts in Amhara and Afar are instigated by the aggression of the TPLF. Had it not been for a one sided reporting, we could have gotten a relatively similar coverage for the three regions in the picture.

Earlier, I have mentioned from my reference article that atrocities are also being reported in one-sided approach. Here, I used additional metadata from ACLED where we can see the main parties/actors involved in the conflict along with the type of conflict and news sources. I also filtered the data for the Tigray region to give more weight on how international media is reporting on the types of the violence and the actors involved in the region. Surprisingly, we find a significant difference between the reporting sources when the involved party is Ethiopian Govt vs TPLF. In this case, a minuscule of the violence against civilians is being reported by the international media concerning TPLF as opposed to the investigation by the UN and Ethiopian Human Rights commission as all parties are involved that stands at 27% as compared to 82% for that of the Ethiopian Govt (Table 2).

###TPLF blatantly missed an opportune for peace and expanded the war to other regions 

The current phase of the war began in late June after the government withdrew its forces from Tigray and declared a unilateral ceasefire. Professor Beharu Zewdie documents this as an opportunity for TPLF to reciprocate the ceasefire and bring the issue to the negotiating table instead of setting out significant hurdles as a precondition and calling the Government’s unilateral ceasefire as “a sick joke”. As you can see from the Figure below, instead, the TPLF offensive act extended to neighboring Amhara and Afar regions.

Table 3 reports on the status of conflict before and after the Government ceasefire. It is unfortunate to see that the conflict in other regions such as Afar, and Amhara increased by many folds due to TPLF aggression since the withdrawal of the government from Tigray region. In contrast, the recorded conflict incidents in Tigray fell by 85% which could be good news for the other regions as well had it been TPLF accepted the ceasefire and did not expand the war into the other regions.

###The current phase of the war 

As documented in the recent [mnesty international report]("https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/ethiopia-survivors-of-tplf-attack-in-amhara-describe-gang-rape-looting-and-physical-assaults/"), TPLF’s attack in Amhara, Involved gang rape, looting and physical assaults. The recent investigation report conducted by the [Ethiopian Human Rights report]("https://ehrc.org/download/investigation-into-human-rights-and-humanitarian-law-violations-in-areas-of-amhara-region-affected-by-the-conflict/") documents that violations of human rights committed by the TPLF may constitute war crimes under the international humanitarian law mentioning at least 184 civilians had been killed in Amhara region with many suffered physical and psychological injuries in the two months period that the report covered (July and August 2021). The property destruction in the two regions are mind blowing. Current estimates for the Amhara region indicate it could take at least three decades to rebuild and bring back the region to the pre-TPLF war economic status where every standing factory has been looted in the region.
